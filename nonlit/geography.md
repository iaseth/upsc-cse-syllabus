circulation; Atmospheric stability and instability. Planetary and local winds; Monsoons and jet streams; Air 
masses and fronto; Temperate and tropical cyclones; Types and distribution of precipitation; Weather and 
Climate; Koppen’s Thornthwaite’s and Trewar Tha’s classification of world climate; Hydrological cycle;

salinity of the oceans; Heat and salt budgets, Ocean deposits; Waves, currents and tides; Marine resources; 
biotic, mineral and energy resources; Coral reefs coral bleaching; Sea-level changes; Law of the sea and 
marine pollution.

ecology and environment; Global and regional ecological changes and imbalances; Ecosystem their 
management and conservation; Environmental degradation, management and conservation; Biodiversity 
and sustainable development; Environmental policy; Environmental hazards and remedial measures;

Perroux and Boudeville; Von Thunen’s model of agricultural location; Weber’s model of industrial location; 
Ostov’s model of stages of growth. Heart-land and Rimland theories; Laws of international boundaries and 
frontiers.
